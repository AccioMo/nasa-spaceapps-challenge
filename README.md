# Farm Quest - NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025

A minimalist web game for the NASA Space Apps Challenge where players manage virtual farms using real-world satellite data and agricultural insights.

## Features

- üîê **Google OAuth Login** - Seamless authentication with Google accounts
- üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Globe Map** - Select farms directly from an interactive 3D globe showing real-world locations across different continents
- üéÆ **Farm Management Game** - Monitor crops, manage resources, and optimize yields
- üõ∞Ô∏è **Space-themed UI** - Minimal dark design with space/satellite aesthetics

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **NextAuth.js** for Google OAuth
- **Google Fonts** (Space Mono, Orbitron) for that cool tech look
- **Lucide React** for icons

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   
   Copy `.env.example` and fill in your credentials:
